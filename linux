Chapter 1: What is Linux?
The first thing that we need to talk about in this book is about the origins of the
Linux. In a nutshell, Linux is an operating system. For those of you who do not
know what an operating system is, and for all of you who think you do but may
have forgotten what an operating system is, it is actually the software layer that is
between your hardware and the software that allows you to get something
productive done on a computer.
The operating system is what allows the software to talk to the hardware. It is the
one that lets you store information on hard drives, send out print jobs to printers,
etc. If you are in a normal Windows environment—a Microsoft Windows
Operating system—you have your hardware at the bottom, you have the Windows
operating system on top of that, and then you have Microsoft Office, for example,
that sits on top of the operating system.
Linux is an operating system that acts as an intermediary—i.e. a bridge—between
the physical device and the instructional code of a program. The main thing that
you just need to realize is that in the Linux world, the software that you will be
running is of a completely different type, compared to the ones that you would run
in the Windows operating system. Desktop applications like Microsoft Office and
Adobe Photoshop are not usually run on a Linux environment. Linux normally
runs servers—Apache web servers, database servers, web virtualization servers,
etc.
